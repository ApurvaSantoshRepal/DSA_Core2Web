/*
Problem Statement 6:
Given a random set of numbers, Print them in sorted order.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 4

arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 2}
Output: {1, 2, 3, 5}
Explanation: After sorting array will
be like {1, 2, 3, 5}.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 2
arr[] = {3, 1}
Output: {1, 3}
Explanation: After sorting array will
be like {1, 3}.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N * log N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1 ≤ N, A[i] ≤ 105
