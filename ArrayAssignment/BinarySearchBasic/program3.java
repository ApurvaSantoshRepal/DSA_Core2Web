/*
Q 3. First Occurrence of an Element
Modify the binary search function to find the first occurrence of a given element in
a sorted array. Return -1 if the element is not present.
For example, given the input array arr = [2, 4, 4, 4, 6, 7, 8] and the target element
4, the function should return 1, as 4 first appears at index 1 in the array.
